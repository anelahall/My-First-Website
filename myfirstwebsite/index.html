  <p>Welcome to my first website! Coding has been something I have been
  interested in since middle school. Just this year I found out I could
take this Web Design at the Career Center! <br>Im really into the production
and the process of making things. When I graduate I plan on working on
feature films and working behind the camera as the director of the next best
movie.</br> Ever since I was little I have been a creative person. Instead of
playing with Barbie dolls I would draw. Now I do very little drawing, but
have found a new love for graphic designs.</p>
