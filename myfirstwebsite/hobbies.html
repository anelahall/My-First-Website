    <p>During the summer time, on average me and my best friend will go "adventuring" probably five days a week. We always hop in the car, grab some friends
    if they are feeling up to it, get some rasberry tea and hit the road. Sometimes we go on back roads in town, follow roads to diffrent towns, or stop in the middle of no where
  get out of the car and start walking. Patyn is good at directions and roads, Im good at picking the right music and being the look out for animals running into the road.</p>

    <p>Over the 2018 summer one of my close friends had mentioned to me, "college is in two years Anela, were gonna be juniors this year."
    When she said that I started freaking out. I didn't know what I wanted to do, I'm honestly not talented with anything. I had no clue what I was going to do with my life.
  What I did know is I like to create things. I love the process of building something from the ground up. So I did what every teenager does in the twenty first century
and googled what kind of jobs I could get as a creative person. I discovered Parsons New School in New York and continued with looking into there Bacholor degrees. I've decided
I want to go to school for my BFA in Art Media and Techology and work on film and graphics design! Of course I most likley not going to Parsons because Im broke, but Missoula offers
the same classes and Im really excited about it!</p>

    <p>Snowboarding is the new reason I pretend to like snow. I started snowboarding in 8th grade. My bestfriend had just gotten a new snowboard, and I decided I wanted
      to try it out! My dad took me to Red Lodge and honestly it was pretty easy to get. I hit a tree last year, that was kinda fun..
      My dad decided to make every new years a tradtion to go hit the slopes, his reasoning.. so I don't feel left out when my friends are together for New Years Eve and my parents
      won't let me go out.
